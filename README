Queueing is an app for macOS that lets you deal with “natural queues” of items that pile up for you to deal with. Designed to fit seamlessly into your existing workflow, Queueing lets you go through queues of photos, notes, reminders, or bookmarks and quickly action them. The quickest way to remember a cool event is to snap a picture of the flier, but then you have to actually look through your camera roll and sort through the cruft. The camera roll isn’t intended to be an event book or a note taking app. Queueing is designed to make this process easy and unstressful.
